## Overview
The 1D Collision Simulator is a multipurpose simulation of momentumn collsions in 1D. This application can take in collision ata between two carts that hit eachother head on and display this collison as well as a graph denoting the positions of the carts relative to there starting positions, as well as there velocities and accelerations.
## Features
1. Graph Rendering
2. Simulation Rendering
3. Import CSV Files
4. User freindly GUI
